# CDR+ Specifications Repository

This is the CDR+ specifications repository. 

It is intended primarily as a container for the various specifications within the [CDR Plus](https://cdrplus.au) project.  For the development oriented this repository is essentially a "monorepo" with cloned components below.

Read more about the [CDR+ initative here](https://cdrplus.au).

## Getting Started

This repository can be used to get started with contributing to CDR+ specifications by doing the following:
1. `git clone git@github.com:cdrplus/cdrplus-specs.git`
2. `cd cdrplus-specs`
3. `./clone-specs.sh`

This will result in a `specs` directory being created with the various specifications checked out. These specifications are based on the [Internet Draft Template](https://github.com/martinthomson/internet-draft-template) recommended by the [Internet-Draft Author Resources](https://authors.ietf.org/en/home).
