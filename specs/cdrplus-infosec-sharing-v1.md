## Authorisation Server

The authorisation server:
1. **SHALL** issue refresh tokens with an expiry matched to the CDR Arrangement;
2. **SHALL NOT** issue refresh tokens for a missing `sharing_duration` or a `sharing_duration` with a value of `0` (see Request Object);
3. **MUST** support the Holder CDR Arrangement Revocation Endpoint (HCARE)
5. **MUST** include the CDR Arrangement ID as an attribute in its Introspection Endpoint response

### Holder CDR Arrangement Revocation Endpoint (HCARE)

The Holder CDR Arrangement (HCARE) Revocation endpoint is a CDR specific endpoint that accepts a CDR Arrangement Identifier and immediately revokes the CDR Sharing Arrangement.

#### HCARE Discovery

The HCARE endpoint **MUST** be advertised using the `cdr_arrangement_revocation_endpoint` attribute at the OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [@!OIDC-Discovery] endpoint.

#### HCARE Request

The protected resource calls the HCARE endpoint using an HTTP POST [@!RFC7231] request with parameters sent as "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" data as defined in [@!W3C.REC-html5-20141028].  The protected resource sends a parameter representing the CDR Arrangement Identifier.

`cdr_arrangement_id`
**REQUIRED**.  The CDR Arrangement Identifier previously provided in the token and introspection endpoint responses.

The client also includes its authentication credentials as described in Section 2.2 of [@!RFC7523] (ie. `private_key_jwt` method).

For example, a Recipient may request CDR Arrangement revocation with the following request:

```
POST https://data.holder.com.au/arrangements/revoke
HTTP/1.1
Host: data.holder.com.au
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&
client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer&
client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJQUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6IjEyNDU2In0.ey ...&
cdr_arrangement_id=5a1bf696-ee03-408b-b315-97955415d1f0
```

The authorisation server first validates the client credentials and then verifies whether the CDR Arrangement Identifier exists and was issued to the client making the arrangement revocation request. If this validation fails, the request is refused and the client is informed of the error by the authorisation server as described below.

In the next step, the authorisation server invalidates the CDR Arrangement and any associated tokens. The invalidation **MUST** take place immediately and **MUST** occur against all Access and Refresh tokens.

#### HCARE Response

The authorisation server **MUST** respond with HTTP status code 204 if the CDR Sharing Arrangement has been revoked successfully. If the CDR Sharing Arrangement was already revoked (but is otherwise valid) the authorisation server **SHOULD** respond with a successful response.

##### Error Response

The error presentation conforms to the definition in Section X.X of [@!CDRPLUS-BASELINE-ERRORS].

The following additional error code is defined for the HCARE endpoint:

`urn:au-cds:error:cds-all:Authorisation/InvalidArrangement`: The arrangement could not be found. The error detail is the CDR Arrangement ID of the being executed.

If the server responds with HTTP status code 503, the client must assume the CDR Arrangement still exists and may retry after a reasonable delay. The server may include a "Retry-After" header in the response to indicate how long the service is expected to be unavailable to the requesting client.

#### Discovery Document

The authorisation server SHALL support discovery, as defined in OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [@!OIDC-Discovery].

Additionally, the authorisation server SHOULD support discovery, as defined in [@!RFC8414].

In addition, the authorisation server
1. **MUST** support the `require_pushed_authorization_requests` parameter as described in [@!RFC9126] at the OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [@!OIDC-Discovery] endpoint
2. **MUST** support the `require_pushed_authorization_requests` parameter as described in [@!RFC9126] at the [@!RFC8414] endpoint
3. **SHOULD** advertise the `require_pushed_authorization_requests` as `true`


### Request Object

The request object submitted to the authorisation server:
1. **MUST** support a claim parameter of `sharing_duration` representing the number of seconds, as an integer, to request a CDR Sharing Arrangement;
2. **MUST** consider `sharing_duration` lengths exceeding `31536000` to be equal to `31536000`;
3. **SHOULD** reject `sharing_duration` values less than `0`;
4. **MUST** support a claim parameter of `cdr_arrangement_id` referencing an existing CDR Arrangement (see CDR Arrangement Identifier);
5. **MUST** reject requests containing an unknown `cdr_arrangement_id`;

### Claims

The authorisation server:
1. **MUST** support the claim `refresh_token_expires_at` representing the expiry of the refresh token as a numeric epoch. If no refresh token has been provided a `0` **SHOULD** be returned;
2. **MUST** support the claim `sharing_expires_at` representing the expiry of the CDR Arrangement. If a `sharing_duration` was not specified in the authorisation request object then a `0` **SHOULD** be returned;
3. **SHOULD** ensure the `exp` claim within refresh tokens is equal to the `sharing_expires_at` claim;

#### CDR Arrangement Identifier

The authorisation server:
1. **MUST** support the claim `cdr_arrangement_id` representing a unique identifier for the CDR Arrangement;
2. **MUST** ensure the `cdr_arrangement_id` is non-guessable;
3. **MUST** ensure the `cdr_arrangement_id` does not identify the Consumer;
4. **SHOULD** ensure the `cdr_arrangement_id` is collision resistant;
5. **MUST** ensure the `cdr_arrangement_id` claim, if specified within the request object and valid, remains static across authorisation flows;
6. **MUST** reject requests referencing a CDR Arrangement which has expired;
7. **MUST** reject requests referencing a CDR Arrangement that does not match the authenticated Consumer;
8. **MUST** revoke previously issued access and refresh tokens when a CDR Arrangement is updated

# Recipient

A Recipient **SHALL** support the provisions specified in clause 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 of [@!FAPI-1.0-Baseline].

In addition, the authorisation client
1. If a Refresh Token is issued for one-time collection the Data Recipient Software Product MUST call the Data Holder’s revocation endpoint after successful collection of the CDR data.
2. The Data Recipient Software Product MAY provide the cdr_arrangement_id claim in the Request Object sent to the PAR End Point.
3. Data Recipient Software Products MAY provide an existing cdr_arrangement_id claim in an authorisation request object to establish a new consent under an existing arrangement
4. **MUST** support the Recipient CDR Arrangement Revocation Endpoint (RCARE)


## Recipient CDR Arrangement Revocation Endpoint (RCARE)

The Recipient CDR Arrangement (RCARE) Revocation endpoint is a CDR specific endpoint that accepts a CDR Arrangement Identifier and immediately revokes the CDR Sharing Arrangement.

### RCARE Request

The protected resource calls the RCARE endpoint using an HTTP POST [@!RFC7231] request with parameters sent as "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" data as defined in [@!W3C.REC-html5-20141028].  The protected resource sends a parameter representing the CDR Arrangement Identifier.

`cdr_arrangement_id`
**RECOMMENDED**. The CDR Arrangement Identifier previously provided in the token and introspection endpoint responses.

`cdr_arrangement_jwt`
**REQUIRED**. A single signed [@!JWT] containing the following parameters:
1. `cdr_arrangement_id` representing the CDR Arrangement Identifier previously provided in the token and introspection endpoint responses;
2. `iss`: The Holder Brand ID as per Section X.X in [@!CDRPLUS-ADMISSION-CONTROL]
3. `sub`: The Holder Brand ID as per Section X.X in [@!CDRPLUS-ADMISSION-CONTROL]
4. `aud`: The URI to the RCARE Endpoint as per Section X.X in [@!CDRPLUS-ADMISSION-CONTROL]
5. `jti`: A unique identifier for the token
6. `exp`: Expiration time on or after the JWT must not be accepted

In addition, the client includes an `Authorization` header parameter with a Bearer token containing a single signed [@!JWT] with the following parameters:
1. `iss`: The Holder Brand ID as per Section X.X in [@!CDRPLUS-ADMISSION-CONTROL]
2. `sub`: The Holder Brand ID as per Section X.X in [@!CDRPLUS-ADMISSION-CONTROL]
3. `aud`: The URI to the RCARE Endpoint as per Section X.X in [@!CDRPLUS-ADMISSION-CONTROL]
4. `jti`: A unique identifier for the token
5. `exp`: Expiration time on or after the JWT must not be accepted

For example, a Holder may request CDR Arrangement revocation with the following request:

```
POST https://data.recipient.com.au/arrangements/revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: data.recipient.com.au
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJQUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6IjEyNDU2In0.ey …

cdr_arrangement_jwt=eyJhbGciOiJQUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6IjEyNDU2In0.ey ...&
cdr_arrangement_id=5a1bf696-ee03-408b-b315-97955415d1f0
```

The Recipient first validates the Holder credentials and then verifies whether the CDR Arrangement Identifier exists and was issued by the Holder making the CDR Arrangement Revocation request. If this validation fails, the request is refused and the Holder is informed of the error by the RCARE endpoint as described below.

In the next step, the Recipient invalidates the CDR Arrangement and **SHOULD** discard associated tokens. Data Minimisation events **SHOULD** also be triggered on receipt of this event.

### RCARE Response

The RCARE endpoint **MUST** respond with HTTP status code 204 if the CDR Sharing Arrangement has been revoked successfully. If the CDR Sharing Arrangement was already revoked (but is otherwise valid) the authorisation server **SHOULD** respond with a successful response.

#### Error Response

The error presentation conforms to the definition in Section X.X of [@!CDRPLUS-BASELINE-ERRORS].

The following additional error code is defined for the HCARE endpoint:

`urn:au-cds:error:cds-all:Authorisation/InvalidArrangement`: The CDR Arrangement Identifier could not be found. The error detail is the CDR Arrangement ID of the being executed.

If the server responds with HTTP status code 503, the client must assume the CDR Arrangement still exists and may retry after a reasonable delay. The server may include a "Retry-After" header in the response to indicate how long the service is expected to be unavailable to the requesting client.
